/**
 * This example demonstrates the infrared receiver component on the CrowPi. Please note that the receiver LED must first be plugged into the
 * three small pinholes labelled as "IR" for this example to work. As Java does not allow for precise enough timings itself, this component
 * does not use Pi4J to retrieve the pulses of the GPIO pin for the IR sensor and instead relies on mode2, an executable provided as part of
 * LIRC for reading from an IR input.
 * <p>
 * A clean alternative would be using a separate microcontroller which handles the super precise timing-based communication itself and
 * interacts with the Raspberry Pi using IÂ²C, SPI or any other bus. This would offload the work and guarantee even more accurate results. As
 * the CrowPi does not have such a dedicated microcontroller though, using `mode2` was the best available approach.
